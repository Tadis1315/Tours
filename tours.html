    <p class="p flex">Tarangire National Park portal is a non-commercial with all information from wildlife, attractions, Tarangire<br /> activities, to safari accommodation, when to go, how to get there, Tarangire Safaris & Tours, Cost of Tarangire<br /> Safari and a travel blog.</p>
    <p class="p flex">Ranking as the 6th largest National Park in Tanzania and covering an area of 2,600 square kilometers, The<br /> Tarangire National Park is most popular for its large elephant herds and mini-wildlife migration that takes place<br /> during the dry season which sees about 250,000 animals enter the park. Located slightly off the popular northern<br /> Tanzania Safari Circuit, the park lies between the meadows of Masai Steppe to the south east and the lakes of the<br /> Great Rift Valley to the north and west. Within the northern part of Tarangire is the permanent River Tarangire also<br /> known as the life-line of the park particularly in the dry season when most of the region is totally dry. This flows <br />northwards until it exits the park in the northwestern corner to pour into Lake Burungi. There are a number of <br />wide swamps which dry into green plains during the dry season in the south.</p>
    <p class="p flex">During you Safari in Tarangire, You are highly recommended to stay for a couple of days especially  in the south of<br /> the park which offers a less crowded safari experience and gives you the opportunity to enjoy an authentic African<br /> feel of the Tanzaniaâ€™s countryside.</p>
